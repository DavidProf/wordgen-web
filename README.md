# wordgen
Hello, this is a simple word generator.

Have you ever needed a random word?
If your answer is no, I can give you some examples:

- learn about something new;
- pratice english;
- pick a random subject for a conversation;
- learn weird words;

Well, this and more. I don't know, why do you will need this? Be creative.

This word generator is easy to use and fast, you will love this (maybe not, this is okay too).

No more words, or better, just any random word:

# Do you want to colaborate?

Maybe you want to translate for another languages, or just do a bug fix, maybe add a new funcionality here, who knows? You are free!

I don't have a pattern to pull request or issues, then just try to be descriptive as possible.
